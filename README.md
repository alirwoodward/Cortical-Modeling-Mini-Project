# Cortical-Modeling-Mini-Project

This project simulates a rate network with the below structure, used used to answer some questions about the behavior of the simulated model.

The network contains two rate models that are connected to each other, each of recieving 3 inputs:
  An external input I_1 and I_2 for population 1 and 2 respectively.
	A self-excitation input.
	An inhibition input from population 1 and 2, to population 2 and 1 respectively
